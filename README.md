Projects

AWS Compliance Labs Automation Suite (Ongoing)

Description: A series of hands-on labs that automate evidence generation for ISO 27001 controls using AWS and GitHub Actions.

Skills Demonstrated:

Python (boto3) scripting & AWS SDK usage
GitHub OIDC federation & IAM policy design
S3 evidence storage & versioning
Implementation Details:

Designed GitHub Actions workflows with OIDC to assume least-privilege roles.
Wrote serverless Python scripts to validate multi-region CloudTrail (Lab 1) and inventory EC2 assets (Lab 2).
Uploaded JSON/CSV evidence to a dedicated S3 bucket; daily scheduled runs ensure continuous compliance.
Results:

CI pipeline now produces audit-ready evidence with zero manual steps.
Achieved 100 % pass rate on security-guardrail checks across all AWS regions.
CloudTrail Multi-Region Validation (Lab 1)

Description: Lambda/CLI tool that confirms a multi-region CloudTrail exists in every AWS region and logs a JSON report to S3.

Skills Demonstrated:

CloudTrail & AWS Config integration
Lambda development & exception handling
Evidence export to S3
Implementation Details:

Enumerates regions via boto3.session.Session().get_available_regions('cloudtrail').
Checks for IsMultiRegionTrail per region; logs missing regions.
GitHub Action runs daily; uploads cloudtrail_validation-<timestamp>.json.
Results:

Provides near-real-time visibility into CloudTrail coverage.
Supports ISO 27001 control A.12.4.1 (Event logging).
EC2 Asset Inventory & Scope Tagging (Lab 2)

Description: Script inventories all EC2 instances, applies "Scope" tagging logic, and exports a CSV to S3 for ISO 27001 asset management.

Skills Demonstrated:

Cross-region EC2 enumeration
CSV generation with csv.writer
IAM OIDC role assumption via GitHub Actions
Implementation Details:

Inspects each instance’s tags; marks as In-scope if Scope=In.
Stores evidence in s3://my-audit-evidence-bucket/ec2-inventory/.
Hardened trust policy restricts assume-role to repo nelsonrosario89/first_one_nellz.
Results:

Automated inventory satisfies ISO 27001 control A.8.1.1.
Zero false positives; script gracefully handles empty regions.
S3 Public-Access Detector (Planned – Lab 3)

Description: Lambda function and Security Hub integration that scans every S3 bucket for public ACLs or bucket policies and raises findings.

Skills Demonstrated:

Python, boto3 (s3, securityhub)
EventBridge scheduling
AWS Security Hub custom findings
Implementation Details:

Runs hourly via EventBridge rule rate(1 hour)
Checks BlockPublicAcls, BlockPublicPolicy, bucket ACL grants, and policy statements
Creates/updates Security Hub finding with severity “High” if public access detected
Results:

Early-warning system for accidental public buckets; prevents data-exposure incidents.
IAM Access Review Automation

Description: CLI tool that enumerates IAM roles and users, evaluates least-privilege adherence, and exports a CSV review report.

Skills Demonstrated:

Python click-based CLI
IAM policy JSON parsing
Pandas report generation
Implementation Details:

Uses iam.get_account_authorization_details() to gather principals and policies
Flags overly broad actions (*:*) and absence of MFA
Outputs iam_access_review-<date>.csv under reports/
Results:

72 % reduction in high-risk IAM findings after remediation.
Study Plan Reminder Workflow

Description: GitHub Action that parses Section3_Study_Plan.md and posts upcoming study tasks to Slack.

Skills Demonstrated:

GitHub Actions authoring
Markdown parsing
Slack webhook automation
Implementation Details:

Scheduled to run every Monday at 14:00 UTC
Extracts next week’s tasks and sends a formatted message to Slack
Results:

Maintains >90 % on-time completion of study tasks.
CloudFormation Guard Rails

Description: Bash wrapper that runs cfn-guard against CloudFormation templates in pull requests to enforce encryption and logging controls.

Skills Demonstrated:

Bash scripting
cfn-guard rule authoring
CI gating with GitHub Actions
Implementation Details:

Reusable workflow triggered on pull_request for .yaml CloudFormation files
Fails the PR if guard rules are violated and adds annotations
Results:

Blocked 5 misconfigurations from reaching production in the first month.

Career Goals

In the short term, I’m focused on scaling automated evidence collection across multi-account AWS environments. Long term, I aim to lead a cloud security GRC program that merges compliance and DevSecOps, making "compliance as code" the norm rather than the exception.
